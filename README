This test is meant to evaluate the two patches at:
	https://github.com/mvduin/linux/commits/patch/tiler-memtype

(merge/rebase/cherry-pick to your favorite 4.7 kernel for omap5)


It should still run without the patches, but this causes MemType::device and
*all* tiled memory to behave like MemType::sync.  (It is however not valid to
explicitly select MemType::sync then since it was introduced by my patch.)


Also recommended:
	echo 44000000.ocp >/sys/bus/platform/drivers/omap_l3_noc/unbind
	echo 4 >/proc/cpu/alignment
to keep any bus errors from escalating to traceback-in-kernel-log-inducing fun.

Don't forget to use cpufreq-set -rg performance or powersave to explicitly
select cpu frequency.  Governor ondemand yields unstable results.
