This test expects the patches at:
	https://github.com/mvduin/linux/commits/work/omapdrm/memtype

(merge/rebase/cherry-pick to your favorite 4.7 kernel for omap5)

Also do this:
	echo 44000000.ocp >/sys/bus/platform/drivers/omap_l3_noc/unbind
	echo 4 >/proc/cpu/alignment
to keep bus errors from escalating to traceback-in-kernel-log-inducing fun.
